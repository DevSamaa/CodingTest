  <div class="our-div">
    <h3> What has drawn you to coding? </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-two"> I have been working in the field of IT for a long time alongside developers and everytime that I got to try a bit of coding I enjoyed it a lot. I'm now ready to get into coding fulltime. </p>
  </div>

  <hr>

  <h3> What do you hope for from the course? </h3>
  <p class="paragraph-three"> I hope to be able to build cool web applications from scratch, once I complete the course. I also hope to meet many like-minded class mates that I can collaborate with. </p>

  <hr>

  <h3> What do you hope to do after the course? </h3>
  <p class="paragraph-four"> I hope to join MYOB and become a fulltime developer there. </p>

  <hr>

  <h3> What is your github username (add a link to your github profile, i.e., https://github.com/username)? </h3>
  <p class="paragraph-four"> My GitHub account is https://github.com/DevSamaa. Or simply <a href="https://github.com/DevSamaa">click here</a> to view it. </p>

  <hr>

  <h3> What did you find most challenging about this test? </h3>
  <p class="paragraph-four"> I struggled the most with installing Visual Studio because I initially got the wrong piece of software that has almost the same name. However once I read over the instructions again carefully, it all worked out. </p>

  <hr>

  <h3> Are there any parts of the test you could not complete? (This is OK, just include notes about what happened in
    your submission) </h3>
  <p class="paragraph-four"> I completed all the parts, however some of the links were not working properly so I had to find alternative ways of solving the problem. I attached a document with the name: ADMISSIONS_TEST_notes that contains all the details of how I completed the test. </p>
